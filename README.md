---------------------------------------

Compilation
-----------

- Download & Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tenjava/se1by-t2`
- Compile and create the plugin package using Maven: `mvn`

Maven will download all required dependencies and build a ready-for-use plugin package!

---------------------------------------

Usage
-----

1. Install plugin
2. Add stuff in conversion.yml
3. Build a lightning rod! They should look like this:

4. Connect it to a chest or a furnace with some redstone!
5. Wait for a thunder (or /toggledownfall ;) )
6. Enjoy your energy!

A little bit more information
-----------------------------

* The longer the cables (redstone) are, the less power they will supply (10 power at start, losing 1 power per cable)
* A connected furnace will gain burning power. A lot, if connected right (The equivalent of a lava bucket at power 10!)
* A connected chest will convert items listed in the conversion.yml
* Put spawn eggs in the chest and you just build your own, thunder powered spawner!


Things that don't work... yet!
------------------------------

* The battery device is still missing - sadly, as it adds so much more to it :/
* The redstone-finding algorithm needs some refactoring - it only finds connections on 1 level
* I'm sure there are some bugs I didn't see, feel free to open an issue!
